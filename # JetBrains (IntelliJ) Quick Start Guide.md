### Version
Before proceeding with the tips and tricks in this guide, please note that at the point of writing this, the newest version of IntelliJ is `2023.1`, using the new and improved UI to ensure the maximum longevity of this guide. Additionally, this guide is tailored to users running IntelliJ on a Windows 11 machine. Please note that some tips and techniques may not be applicable to earlier versions of IntelliJ or different operating systems. In most cases MacOS users will be able to replace most usages of <kbd>CTRL</kbd> &harr; <kbd>cmd</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd> &harr; <kbd>Option</kbd>

## Cheat Sheet
Using a cheat sheet for shortcuts can greatly enhance your productivity and efficiency when using the software. With so many different features and functionalities available, it can be difficult to remember all of the keyboard shortcuts and menu options that are available to you. By using a cheat sheet, you can easily access a comprehensive list of shortcuts and other important information that you need to know, saving you time and effort in the long run.

Furthermore, a cheat sheet can help you become more proficient in using the software and can serve as a valuable reference tool as you continue to work with IntelliJ. By having a printed cheat sheet in front of you, you can quickly find the shortcuts and features you need to use, without having to navigate through menus or search for the information online.

A physical copy of a cheat sheet can be a valuable resource for learning and utilizing keyboard shortcuts in IntelliJ. Unlike a digital copy, a physical cheat sheet allows you to mark it up with notes and annotations, highlight frequently used shortcuts, and create mnemonic devices to help you remember the information more easily

A plugin that can help you learn and integrate keyboard shortcuts into your workflow is the [`Key Promoter X`](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9792-key-promoter-x) plugin. This plugin is designed to help you improve your productivity by reminding you every time you perform an action that could be done more efficiently using a shortcut. The plugin keeps track of your actions and prompts you with a notification every time an action has a corresponding keyboard shortcut available. This serves as a gentle reminder to use shortcuts and helps you to learn them more quickly by providing immediate feedback. With the help of this plugin, you can gradually integrate keyboard shortcuts into your workflow, leading to faster and more efficient use of IntelliJ.
